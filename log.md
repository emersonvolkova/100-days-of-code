# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Learned about 100 Days of Code and I will be dedicating myself to investing 1 hour per day moving forward. Learned about Github fork feature and familiarized myself with the Github interface.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with these past two months to keep coding. School really threw me off, and just as I wrapped one class, three projects land in my lap. I'm overwhelmed, but I really, really, REALLY want to finish my certification. I've also been stressing about the upcoming interview I have with Apple in 4 days. It could be excitement, but I don't want to drop the ball this time. Next up! Studying for this interview.
